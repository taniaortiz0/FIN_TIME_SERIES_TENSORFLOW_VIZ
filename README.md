# 📘 Project Overview
This project explores financial time series forecasting by building and training models in TensorFlow to predict future stock price movements. Using historical stock data, the notebook applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and deep learning techniques to analyze trends and generate forecasts.

The goal is twofold:

1. Demonstrate the use of machine learning in financial modeling.
2. Visualize and interpret results to assess predictive performance.

# 📝 Keynotes

- Implemented time series preprocessing: normalization, train/test splits, and sequence generation.
- Built deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, RNN, or GRU) to capture sequential dependencies.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.
- Visualized training history, predicted vs. actual prices, and future forecast trends.
- Highlighted strengths and limitations of deep learning in financial forecasting.

# 🚀 Future Improvements

- Experiment with attention mechanisms or transformer-based architectures for better sequence modeling.
- Incorporate external financial indicators (e.g., interest rates, macroeconomic data, sentiment analysis).
- Enhance hyperparameter tuning with grid search or Bayesian optimization.
- Deploy the forecasting model as a web dashboard for interactive use.
- Extend evaluation with backtesting strategies to simulate trading scenarios.
