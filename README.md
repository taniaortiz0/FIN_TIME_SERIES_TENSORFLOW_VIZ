# ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project explores financial time series forecasting by building and training models in TensorFlow to predict future stock price movements. Using historical stock data, the notebook applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and deep learning techniques to analyze trends and generate forecasts.

The goal is twofold:

1. Demonstrate the use of machine learning in financial modeling.
2. Visualize and interpret results to assess predictive performance.
